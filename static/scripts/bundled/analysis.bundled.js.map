This would make the hierarchy much taller. I've\n    decided to merge the contained JSON with the DC element json - making the 'has a'\n    relation into an 'is a' relation. This seems simpler to me and allowed a lot of\n    DRY in both models and views, but may make tracking or tracing within these models\n    more difficult (since DatasetCollectionElements are now *also* DatasetAssociations\n    or DatasetCollections (nested)). This also violates the rule of thumb about\n    favoring aggregation over inheritance.\n- Currently, there are three DatasetCollection subclasses: List, Pair, and ListPaired.\n    These each should a) be usable on their own, b) be usable in the context of\n    nesting within a collection model (at least in the case of ListPaired), and\n    c) be usable within the context of other container models (like History or\n    LibraryFolder, etc.). I've tried to separate/extract classes in order to\n    handle those three situations, but it's proven difficult to do in a simple,\n    readable manner.\n- Ideally, histories and libraries would inherit from the same server models as\n    dataset collections do since they are (in essence) dataset collections themselves -\n    making the whole nested structure simpler. This would be a large, error-prone\n    refactoring and migration.\n\nMany of the classes and heirarchy are meant as extension points so, while the\nrelations and flow may be difficult to understand initially, they'll allow us to\nhandle the growth or flux dataset collection in the future (w/o actually implementing\nany YAGNI).\n\n*/\n//_________________________________________________________________________________________________ ELEMENTS\n/** @class mixin for Dataset collection elements.\n *      When collection elements are passed from the API, the underlying element is\n *          in a sub-object 'object' (IOW, a DCE representing an HDA will have HDA json in element.object).\n *      This mixin uses the constructor and parse methods to merge that JSON with the DCE attribtues\n *          effectively changing a DCE from a container to a subclass (has a --> is a).\n */\nvar DatasetCollectionElementMixin = {\n    /** default attributes used by elements in a dataset collection */\n    defaults: {\n        model_class: \"DatasetCollectionElement\",\n        element_identifier: null,\n        element_index: null,\n        element_type: null\n    },\n\n    /** merge the attributes of the sub-object 'object' into this model */\n    _mergeObject: function(attributes) {\n        // Don't let the dataset ID replace the DCE's ID so record it as the\n        // element_id and when fetching dataset details below use the element_id\n        // instead of this.id.\n        const object = attributes.object;\n        let elementId = this.elementId;\n        if (object) {\n            elementId = attributes.object.id;\n            delete attributes.object.id;\n        }\n        _.extend(attributes, attributes.object, {\n            element_id: elementId\n        });\n        delete attributes.object;\n        return attributes;\n    },\n\n    /** override to merge this.object into this */\n    constructor: function(attributes, options) {\n        // console.debug( '\\t DatasetCollectionElement.constructor:', attributes, options );\n        attributes = this._mergeObject(attributes);\n        this.idAttribute = \"element_id\";\n        Backbone.Model.apply(this, arguments);\n    },\n\n    /** when the model is fetched, merge this.object into this */\n    parse: function(response, options) {\n        var attributes = response;\n        attributes = this._mergeObject(attributes);\n        return attributes;\n    }\n};\n\n/** @class Concrete class of Generic DatasetCollectionElement */\nvar DatasetCollectionElement = Backbone.Model.extend(BASE_MVC.LoggableMixin)\n    .extend(DatasetCollectionElementMixin)\n    .extend({ _logNamespace: \"collections\" });\n\n//==============================================================================\n/** @class Base/Abstract Backbone collection for Generic DCEs - \n    current may be associated with a dataset (DatasetDCECollection)\n    or another collection (NestedDCDCECollection).\n*/\nvar DCECollection = Backbone.Collection.extend(BASE_MVC.LoggableMixin).extend(\n    /** @lends DCECollection.prototype */ {\n        _logNamespace: \"collections\",\n\n        model: DatasetCollectionElement,\n\n        /** String representation. */\n        toString: function() {\n            return [\"DatasetCollectionElementCollection(\", this.length, \")\"].join(\"\");\n        }\n    }\n);\n\n//==============================================================================\n/** @class Backbone model for a dataset collection element that is a dataset (HDA).\n */\nvar DatasetDCE = DATASET_MODEL.DatasetAssociation.extend(\n    BASE_MVC.mixin(\n        DatasetCollectionElementMixin,\n        /** @lends DatasetDCE.prototype */ {\n            /** url fn */\n            url: function() {\n                // won't always be an hda\n                if (!this.has(\"history_id\")) {\n                    console.warn(\"no endpoint for non-hdas within a collection yet\");\n                    // (a little silly since this api endpoint *also* points at hdas)\n                    return `${getAppRoot()}api/datasets`;\n                }\n                const datasetId = this._getDatasetId();\n                const url = `${getAppRoot()}api/histories/${this.get(\"history_id\")}/contents/${datasetId}`;\n                return url;\n            },\n\n            _getDatasetId: function() {\n                // I'm a DCE acting as dataset, this URL needs to be the dataset URL so\n                // use element_id instead of id.
